# Exam Seat Allotment - Frontend (React + Tailwind)

This project is a frontend scaffold that reproduces the Figma screens you provided. It uses Vite + React + Tailwind CSS and provides routes and pages matching the designs: Login, Dashboard, Exams, Register Students, Rooms, and Final Seat Allotment.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
# from project root d:\MY_PROJECTS\mini_pro2
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the site at the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes:
- This is a static/frontend-only prototype. No backend is included.
- Forms and buttons are wired for demonstration only; they don't persist data.
- Colors and spacing approximate your Figma screens. Tell me which areas you'd like refined.
